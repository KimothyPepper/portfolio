        <p class="text-center">Currently a third year graphic design student at Algonquin College. Web Design, photography and UX Design are some of my main passions. I love to travel and experience new things everyday.</p>
        <p>Ever since I was younger, I have always loved to draw and create things by hand. My mother and grandpa had always influenced me with art.</p>
        <p>As I grew older it was something I would do on the side or in art classes but never really thought of a future in it. Towards then end of my high school journey, I was introduced to graphic design by one of my teachers. After creating some pieces and learning about the field, I realized this was the career for me.
        <p>Being able to communicate my ideas while including design makes this all so motivating.</p>
